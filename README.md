`Why move the top pinky keys to the side?`  
 > Moving my pinky to the side rather than top feels more natural and limits the movement and rotation of my hands on the board.  
This 'pinky cluster' is inspired by boards like [balbuzard](https://github.com/brow/balbuzard) and [osprette](https://github.com/smores56/osprette)
