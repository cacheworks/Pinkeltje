__Why move the top pinky keys to the side?__  

 Moving my pinky to the side instead of upwards feels more natural and limits the movement and rotation of my hands on the board.  
This 'pinky cluster' is inspired by boards like [balbuzard](https://github.com/brow/balbuzard) and [osprette](https://github.com/smores56/osprette)
